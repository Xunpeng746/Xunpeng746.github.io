I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/).
Before that, I finished my B.sc. degree in School of Mathematics and Computer Science from [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/).
I got my M.sc. degree in School of Computer Science and Technology from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/).
Besides, I worked for [Bytedance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/) supervised by [Prof. Lei Li](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lilei/).
My current research interests include stochastic/nonconvex optimization and deep learning theory.
