I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), co-advised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/) and [Prof. Yang Xiang](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~maxiang/).
I am furtunate work closely with [Prof. Yi-an Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home) (University of California San Diego) and [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/) (The University of Hong Kong).
Before that, I finished my B.sc. degree in School of Mathematics and Computer Science from [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/).
I got my M.sc. degree in School of Computer Science and Technology from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/).
Besides, I used to work at [Bytedance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/) under [Prof. Lei Li](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lilei/)'s supervision.
My current research interests are machine learning algorithms and theory including sampling algorithms, stochastic/nonconvex optimization and mean-field analysis.
